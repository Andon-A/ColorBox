Andon's Colorbox
=================
Created for a christmas gift.
Each of four units is a Pi Zero W, connected to the internet.
Each has two buttons and a Blinkt! attached.
Each unit controls two of the eight RGB LEDs, and sends information over the interwebs to the others.

Units pull updates every 15 seconds, and push updates once per minute.
These update pushes are made on an offset, so nobody will be pushing at the same time.
